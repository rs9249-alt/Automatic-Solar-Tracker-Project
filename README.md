An *Automatic Solar Tracker* that dynamically adjusts the position of a solar panel to face the direction of maximum sunlight, thereby improving energy harvesting efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional fixed solar panels cannot continuously face the sun, which reduces their efficiency.  
This project solves that problem by automatically rotating the solar panel using a motor-controlled mechanism based on sunlight intensity.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- Light sensors detect sunlight intensity
- The control circuit compares sensor values
- A motor driver controls a DC motor
- The motor rotates the panel towards the brighter direction
- This ensures maximum exposure to sunlight throughout the day
